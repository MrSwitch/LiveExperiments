# LiveExperiments on GitHub

A collection of demos and mock sites i've created to illustrate Windows Live API. 
Now open source and on GitHub!


# Aim of LiveExperiments

1. To provide working online demonstration of the Windows Live API
2. To provide mock sites which illustrate social distribution in general
3. To be fully open source with MIT licences
4. To appropriatly accredit anyone who wants to chip-in


# Demos

1. New demos should be submitted into the correct directory which is the working version of Windows Live
2. Each demos should exist in a self contained .html file, ideally
3. Demos should take the default style as adopted by other demos


# TODO

There are a number of demos to create which would fill in the table on the homepage. 
I'd also like to expand the site to other Social Networks API's for comparison and add these to the Mashups section below.
